# Linux Driver Development for Embedded Processors

This workspace contains modules and drivers that are written as
part of the book `Linux Driver Development for Embedded Processors`
by Alberto Liberal de los Rios.

## Out of tree modules

The modules in this directory are out of tree modules (no part of the Linux Kernel image).
This means that after compiling these modules, they have to be moved to the target running
the embedded Linux.
